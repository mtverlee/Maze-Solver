# Maze-Solver
Python script that solves mazes in image form. Note: This script can be RAM intensive, so don't try to solve too big of mazes unless you have a ton of RAM. :)

## Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/mtverlee/Maze-Solver.git
```

Then, in the Maze-Solver directory:
```
./install.sh
source run/bin/activate
python solve.py [-m] <input_file> <output_file>
```

To exit from the virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```

## Solution:
Check your output file and you will see the solution to the maze!
Blue is the start of the maze, and red is the end.
